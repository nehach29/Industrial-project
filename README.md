The Weather Forecasting Project is a machine learning-based initiative aimed at predicting weather conditions and providing accurate forecasts. This project utilizes historical weather data, meteorological variables, and advanced algorithms to generate predictions for various locations and timeframes.
The project collects and aggregates historical weather data from reliable sources, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, precipitation, and atmospheric pressure.
